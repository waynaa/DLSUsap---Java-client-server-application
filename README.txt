**DLSUsap** is a one-on-one chat application implemented in Java. It is a simple client-server application that sends and receives messages. Threading is implemented to ensure that the server will continuously run and listen while the clients are connected. The server used TCP as its transport layer protocol & supports two (2) clients. The client is done on a simple GUI. As long as the connection is open, the client can send and receive messages. The connection will be terminated if the client logs out or closes their chat window.
